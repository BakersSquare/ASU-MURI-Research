Overview:
This folder contains the convolutional neural network for mapping IceSat-2 accuracy onto Sentinel2 SAR imaging.
In the future, the Sentinel2 data will be replaced with ICEYE's SPOT resolution SAR which will provide much better
geo-spatial accuracy. Although Sentinel2's SAR imaging has much lower resolution (50m compared to ICEYE's 1m), it is
much more available and we already have a more-or-less coincident test case to work with. For the development of the model,
Sentinel2 data will be treated as if it were ICEYE data so that a successful model should map well to our ordered
ICEYE data product.
