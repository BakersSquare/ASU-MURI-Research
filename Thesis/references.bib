abstract = {The Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), in domains like computer vision, mostly reduced the need for handcrafted features due to its ability to learn the problem-specific features from the raw input data. However, the selection of dataset-specific CNN architecture, which mostly performed by either experience or expertise is a time-consuming and error-prone process. To automate the process of learning a CNN architecture, this paper attempts at finding the relationship between Fully Connected (FC) layers with some of the characteristics of the datasets. The CNN architectures, and recently datasets also, are categorized as deep, shallow, wide, etc. This paper tries to formalize these terms along with answering the following questions. (i) What is the impact of deeper/shallow architectures on the performance of the CNN w.r.t. FC layers?, (ii) How the deeper/wider datasets influence the performance of CNN w.r.t. FC layers?, and (iii) Which kind of architecture (deeper/shallower) is better suitable for which kind of (deeper/wider) datasets. To address these findings, we have performed experiments with four CNN architectures having different depths. The experiments are conducted by varying the number of FC layers. We used four widely used datasets including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, Tiny ImageNet, and CRCHistoPhenotypes to justify our findings in the context of image classification problem.

abstract = {Operations in ice-covered waters require good engineering to ensure the safety of personnel and the environment. In polar regions, the presence of sea ice is the main factor hindering the operations. It affects shipping, and oil and gas exploration and development. This paper looks at the stage of knowledge and applications of the engineering properties of sea ice. The physical properties (microstructure, thickness, salinity, porosity, and density) and the mechanical properties (tensile, flexural, shear, uni-axial compression and multi-axial compression strength, borehole strength, failure envelope, creep, elastic and strain modulus, Poisson's ratio, fracture toughness and friction) are explored. The paper outlines these properties for both first-year sea ice and Old Ice (i.e. second-year and multi-year sea ice). Although some properties are reasonably well understood (microstructure, salinity, flexural strength, compressive strength, and elastic modulus), others are not. Knowledge of Old Ice is particularly limited.}
