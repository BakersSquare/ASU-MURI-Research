abstract = {The Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), in domains like computer vision, mostly reduced the need for handcrafted features due to its ability to learn the problem-specific features from the raw input data. However, the selection of dataset-specific CNN architecture, which mostly performed by either experience or expertise is a time-consuming and error-prone process. To automate the process of learning a CNN architecture, this paper attempts at finding the relationship between Fully Connected (FC) layers with some of the characteristics of the datasets. The CNN architectures, and recently datasets also, are categorized as deep, shallow, wide, etc. This paper tries to formalize these terms along with answering the following questions. (i) What is the impact of deeper/shallow architectures on the performance of the CNN w.r.t. FC layers?, (ii) How the deeper/wider datasets influence the performance of CNN w.r.t. FC layers?, and (iii) Which kind of architecture (deeper/shallower) is better suitable for which kind of (deeper/wider) datasets. To address these findings, we have performed experiments with four CNN architectures having different depths. The experiments are conducted by varying the number of FC layers. We used four widely used datasets including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, Tiny ImageNet, and CRCHistoPhenotypes to justify our findings in the context of image classification problem.

abstract = {Operations in ice-covered waters require good engineering to ensure the safety of personnel and the environment. In polar regions, the presence of sea ice is the main factor hindering the operations. It affects shipping, and oil and gas exploration and development. This paper looks at the stage of knowledge and applications of the engineering properties of sea ice. The physical properties (microstructure, thickness, salinity, porosity, and density) and the mechanical properties (tensile, flexural, shear, uni-axial compression and multi-axial compression strength, borehole strength, failure envelope, creep, elastic and strain modulus, Poisson's ratio, fracture toughness and friction) are explored. The paper outlines these properties for both first-year sea ice and Old Ice (i.e. second-year and multi-year sea ice). Although some properties are reasonably well understood (microstructure, salinity, flexural strength, compressive strength, and elastic modulus), others are not. Knowledge of Old Ice is particularly limited.}

abstract={The method of speckle reduction is widely used in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery over the last three decades. The SAR images are inherently speckled in nature. Speckle noise is a granular pattern distribution, usually modeled as a multiplicative noise that affects the SAR images, as well as all coherent images. Other SAR related problems are also discussed in this paper. Therefore, despeckling approaches are needed to improve the quality of SAR images. However, there is a trade-off between speckle reduction and the preservation of fine details in the despeckled SAR image. The reduction of the speckle noise without losing the fine details of the SAR image is a diffucult task. However, many despeckling methods have been discussed to reduce the speckle noise from the SAR images. Each method has their own norms, advantages and disadvantages. This article contains a review of some major work in the field of SAR image despeckling. Often, scientists and scholars have faced the struggle to understand the pattern distribution of the speckle noise in SAR images. Hence, a brief details about radar, SAR imaging, speckle noise in SAR images and the prevalent approaches of SAR image despeckling are reviewed here. The advantages and disadvantages of SAR image despeckling approaches are also analysed and discussed.},

ABSTRACT = {Speckle noise is an inherent problem of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images, which not only seriously affects the acquisition of SAR image information, but also greatly reduces the efficiency of image segmentation and feature classification. Therefore, research on how to effectively suppress speckle noise while preserving SAR image content information as much as possible has received increasing attention. Based on the non-local idea of SAR image block-matching three-dimensional (SAR-BM3D) algorithm and the concept of sparse representation, a novel SAR image despeckling algorithm is proposed. The new algorithm uses K-means singular value decomposition (K-SVD) to learn the dictionary to distinguish valid information and speckle noise and constructs a block filter based on K-SVD for despeckling, so as to avoid strong point diffusion problem in SAR-BM3D and achieve better speckle noise suppression with stronger adaptability. The experimental results on real SAR images show that the proposed algorithm achieves better comprehensive effect of speckle noise suppression in terms of evaluation indicators and information preservation of SAR images compared with several existing algorithms.},
