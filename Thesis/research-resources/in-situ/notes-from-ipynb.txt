-----track-graphs-p-test---------------
Normalized Standard Deviation:  0.1409347955269019
Normalized Test p-value = 3.56337e-34
The null hypothesis can be rejected

------auger-vs-em-thickness------------
EM Thickness Readings are easier to take than measurements from an Auger.
This dataset contains 469 manual readings, and 21539 EM readings.
Thus, we want to examine how much we can trust those measurements by exploring the relationship between them.

y = 0.92x + 0.18
Adjusted R^2 Value: 0.8659843457694136
P Value: 2.313840006273919e-202
The adjusted R^2 Value and low P value demonstrate there is a high correlation between these variables, and our model captures a significant portion of the variance.
