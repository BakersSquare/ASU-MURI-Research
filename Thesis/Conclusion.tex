\chapter{Conclusion}
\label{sec:Conclusion}

The result of this thesis is a rough pipeline that links elusive data to a intuitive method of better modeling sea ice. IceSat-2's semi-frequent orbit provides data that can, with planning, be corroborated with other data sources to bridge the gap between different remote sensing methods. The results of the experimentation do not suggest the model is capable of deducing sea-ice thickness from mere SAR imaging.
