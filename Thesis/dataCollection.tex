\chapter{Data Collection}
\label{sec:Data_Collection}

The data collection portion of this project is immediately tasked with the following set of problems: spatial coincidence, temporal coincidence, and resolution. Given the asynchronous orbits of each satellite and the incompatible resolutions of NASA's SN-2 with its own IS-2, other avenues were explored to obtain precise SAR imaging. Particularly, the European Space Agency (ESA) offered the
