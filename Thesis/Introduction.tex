-Why is sea ice important, and what are the applications of understanding it at a closer scale?-

\indent In recent decades, understanding the state of sea ice has grown increasingly more important. Sea ice analysis at large scales can provide valuable insight into the trajectory of climate change and at local scale has implications in fields like arctic navigation. Understanding sea-ice thickness in particular, is important for both of these applications.  For example, the thickness of the ice can be analyzed over time to track ice mass in relation to global warning or interpreted locally to predict shipping speed through ice-covered water. \cite{sea-ice-properties}

-How is sea ice currently captured?- 

\indent Due to the harsh nature of the arctic, in-situ studies of arctic ice are infrequent both in time and space. Thus, most analyses depend heavily on remote sensing methods. These methods cumulatively provide magnitudes more data than in-situ measurements can achieve, but differ in modality, methodology and resolution. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and light detection and ranging (LiDAR) are some such modalities that survey the arctic region. Furthermore, organizations like the the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and European Space Agency (ESA) freely provide this information through their constellation of satellites.

Each of these remote sensing methods have their individual strengths and limitations.
 ICESat\-2 (IS\-2), a NASA LiDAR satellite, works by emitting individual photons and timing their returns.
  Praised for its precision, its readings are statistically corrected to adjust for ambient light, cloud occlusion (atmospheric scattering), snow and ice scattering, and the physical problem of first-photon bias \cite{ICESat-2-ATL10-Product}.
	 IS\-2's statistical robustness offers valuable local observation with less than 5 m total geolocation error (mean \(+ 1\sigma\))\cite{ICESat-2-Horizontal-Accuracy}

Background of how sea-ice currently measured: In-situ, LiDar, SAR. Discuss the advantages that SAR and LiDar have over In-situ measurements (e.g. availability), but how they are innately less confident in their accuracies.

-What are the current data sources of these measurements, and what are their limitations. E.g. NASA's IceSat and Sentinel 1/2, ESA, the NSIDC?- 

\indent Discuss the prevalent sources of data as it stands - NSIDC as a data repository, NASA's Sentinel(1/2), IceSat-2, CryoSat satellites as periodic sources of data. Also give an overview as to how each medium works. This might need to span multiple paragraphs.


-Acknowledge that even with the best of the remote sensing methods, many extrapolations of ice-thickness rely on the same fundamental assumption (cite the source that mentioned this)-
Discuss isostatic equilibrium and how the physics of it requires density constants which aren't known or measured, and that density itself is dependent on factors like salinity, temperature, and age, all of which are unknown at local temporal and geographic scale. Current research attempts to quantify density have yielded a somewhat consistent range of values between **foo** and **bar**, but even this range has been disputed to be inaccurate [citing the IceSat-2 \& CryoSat study, the In-Situ analysis]. (Consider attaching the limitation of distance to the reference surface here, or include it in the limitations).

-Given the limitations, transition into the main idea of the thesis. Mapping LiDAR onto SAR?- 

Transition into how SAR imaging can capture a return that indicates sea ice thickness, but it's low resolution from Sentinel-2 prevents it from being local in context. The intuition behind the remainder of the thesis is to coincide precise IceSat-2 LiDAR and data derivatives with widespread SAR imaging, to determine whether sea-ice thickness can be a learnable property from SAR image returns.

The problems with this include the availability of applicable data (such as high-resolution SAR, as the precision of IceSat-2 is immediately lost with low-resolution imagery) and also the coincidence of these two modalities, both spatially and temporally.

-Remove everything from preliminary research - it's not important to the paper. Include the figures of all In-Situ measurements in the Beaufort Sea Region for demonstration of its unavailability especially in relation to the time horizon. Also include the buoyancy chart when discussing the limitations.-
% \indent After reviewing the preliminary research, this paper will move forward to a more targeted effort in obtaining and analyzing data to develop a machine learning model that can be used to predict ice thickness from said remote sensing methods. Chapter 2 will describe the process of obtaining the selected data, and Chapter 3 will discuss the methodology of developing the model.

Importantly, it's important to recognize that laser altimetry is purely restricted to measuring Earth's surface - meaning the returned measurements are innately incapable of measuring sea-ice thickness, especially in the presence of snow on the surface. (Add source and put it in bibliography)

NASA's ICESat-2 L4 Along-Track Sea Ice Thickness highlights this problem, and addresses it using the assumption of hydro-static equilibrium. This equation, expressed as follows, uses the densities of water, sea-ice and snow, alongside the height of the snow to calculate the correlated thickness of the sea ice.

% Data of interest were the IceSat-2 ATL10 product and the NSIDC In-situ Dataset, selected for their combination of breadth and accuracy. Furthermore, the European Space Agency's requirements for sponsored data need to be explored to pursue the higher resolution SAR imagery hoped for. The in-situ measurements will provide an invaluable source of ground truth while the ATL10 product will drastically expand the flexibility and accessibility of sea ice freeboard data moving forward.

\paragraph*{}
The "On-Ice Arctic Sea Ice Thickness Measurements by Auger, Core, and Electromagnetic Induction, from the Late 1800s Onward, Version 2" contains 69,750 rows of data, spanning 5 categorized regions; the Arctic Ocean, the Beaufort Sea, Greenland Coast, Prudhoe Bay, and Russian Coast. Filtering down to the Beaufort Sea region, a region of interest, yields 23 separate studies ranging between 1958 and 2016.

A single delivery of IceSat-2's ATL10 data product yields a '.h5' file, incompatible with traditional spreadsheets. To access IceSat-2 data in a meaningful way involved developing a script to extract relevant information according to the types enumerated in the data product specification. Columns of interest include the latitude, longitude, time, and calculated freeboard height for each of the three beam pairs.
// Consider adding perl and dynamically adding sample rows from the extracted .h5 file. This will give the reader context as to what's being gathered /
